Shedinja
{
    name = S-tier Endless Carry
    item = 
    ability = Wonder Guard
    evs = 0
    nature = Whatever
    moves = Leech Seed / Sappy Seed, Salt Cure, Soak, Ruination / Super Fang
    comment = - Access to the only item and shiny duplication in the game. Give it any item and once you evolve it, both Ninjask and Shedinja will have Nincadas items.
- Wonder Guard Shedinja is the only Pokémon with true immunity, allowing you full control over a fight
- Magic Guard allows Shedinja to ignore non-direct hits, making Wonder Guard more potent.

These three facts alone make Shedinja the very best Pokémon for endless as it can single-handedly beat the current Endless gamemode.
    tags = Endless
