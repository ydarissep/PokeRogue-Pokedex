    comment = - Access to the only item and shiny duplication in the game. Give it any item and once you evolve it, both Ninjask and Shedinja will have Nincadas items
- Wonder Guard Shedinja has a lot of immunities, allowing you full control over a fight
- Magic Guard allows Shedinja to ignore non-direct hits, making Wonder Guard more potent

These three facts alone make Shedinja the very best Pokémon for endless as it can single-handedly beat the current Endless gamemode.
