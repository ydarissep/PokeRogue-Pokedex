{
    name = S-Tier - DoT Late Game Carry
    tags = Endless
    author = Ydarissep
    passive = Any (after splicing), preferably Magic Guard
    ability = Wonder Guard
    fusion = Any Dark/Normal type -> Shedinja
    nature = Any
    moves = Leech Seed (Spliced) / Sappy Seed (Spliced), Salt Cure (Spliced), Soak (Spliced), Ruination (Spliced) / Super Fang (Spliced)
    comment = - Access to the only item and shiny duplication in the game. Give it any item and once you evolve it, both Ninjask and Shedinja will have Nincadas items
- Wonder Guard Shedinja has a lot of immunities, allowing you full control over a fight
- Magic Guard allows Shedinja to ignore non-direct hits, making Wonder Guard more potent

These three facts alone make Shedinja the very best Pokémon for endless as it can single-handedly beat the current Endless gamemode.

    passive = Prankster

    fusion = Smeargle -> Shedinja
    nature = Any
    moves = Nature's Madness (spliced), Conversion, Dragon Tail (spliced/sketched), Sappy Seed (spliced/sketched) / Leech Seed (spliced/sketched) / Worry Seed (spliced/sketched)
    comment = - By switching the order of your moves you can change what typing you will gain through the use of conversion. You want to be a typing that cannot be hit super effectively by your opponent
- Wonder Guard is the only ability with true immunity, allowing you to ignore most attacks
- Prankster allows you to use Conversion with priority, letting you outspeed opposing non-priority moves
    
It is recommended to have seperate Pokémon able to Gastro Acid and Soak opposing Pokémon, as those moves beat Smeargle-Shedinja counters.

    moves = Metal Burst (Spliced), Protect, Roar (TM) / Dragon Tail (TM), Gastro Acid (Spliced)
    comment = - You want to make sure this does not have any Lum Berries if you run the Poison Heal variant
- Stock up on all healing items other than berries
- You want a minimum of 50k HP by wave 5500, preferably above 100k HP.
- Make sure you have the Toxic Orb on your Blastoise when fused with the Poison Heal Breloom.

Using Metal Burst with this set up allows you to deal damage equal to your Pokémon's HP upon being hit. The Toxic Orb + Poison Heal Variant allows you to heal back up without Berries.
It is recommended to have other Pokémon able to use Damage over Time (DoT) moves such as Leech Seed, Salt Cure and Curse.

    comment = - Using Entrainment gives the opponent the Normalize ability
- Fake Out, Gastro Acid and Roar exist to support the team against troublesome opponents
- Stock up on Reviver Seeds and Focus Bands to ensure your moves going off

Entraining Normalize onto opponents allows you to immune all opposing attacks onto your ghost types as their attacks become normal type.
