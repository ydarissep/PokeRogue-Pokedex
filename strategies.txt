Shedinja
{
    name = S-tier Endless Carry
    passive = Any
    ability = Wonder Guard
    fusion = Shedinja -> Any Dark/Normal type
    nature = Whatever
    moves = Leech Seed (spliced) / Sappy Seed (spliced), Salt Cure (spliced), Soak (spliced), Ruination (spliced) / Super Fang (spliced)
    comment = - Access to the only item and shiny duplication in the game. Give it any item and once you evolve it, both Ninjask and Shedinja will have Nincadas items.
- Wonder Guard Shedinja is the only Pokémon with true immunity, allowing you full control over a fight
- Magic Guard allows Shedinja to ignore non-direct hits, making Wonder Guard more potent.

These three facts alone make Shedinja the very best Pokémon for endless as it can single-handedly beat the current Endless gamemode.
    tags = Endless

Shedinja
{
    name = S-Tier - Conversion Lategame Carry
    author = Lucas
    tags = Endless
    passive = Prankster
    ability = Wonder Guard
    fusion = Smeargle -> Shedinja
    nature = Any
    moves = Nature's Madness (spliced), Conversion, Dragon Tail (spliced/sketched), Sappy Seed (spliced/sketched) / Leech Seed (spliced/sketched) / Worry Seed (spliced/sketched)
    comment = - By switching the order of your moves you can change what typing you will gain through the use of conversion. You want to be a typing that cannot be hit super effectively by your opponent.
- Wonder Guard is the only ability with true immunity, allowing you to ignore most attacks.
- Prankster allows you to use Conversion with priority, letting you outspeed opposing non-priority moves.
It is recommended to have seperate Pokémon able to Gastro Acid and Soak opposing Pokémon, as those moves beat Smeargle-Shedinja counters.
