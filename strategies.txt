    comment = - Access to the only item and shiny duplication in the game. Give it any item and once you evolve it, both Ninjask and Shedinja will have Nincadas items
- Wonder Guard Shedinja has a lot of immunities, allowing you full control over a fight
- Magic Guard allows Shedinja to ignore non-direct hits, making Wonder Guard more potent

These three facts alone make Shedinja the very best Pokémon for endless as it can single-handedly beat the current Endless gamemode.

- Use Protect to stall a turn in order to heal back up to full
- Has the most base HP out of any sturdy passive Pokémon but lacks good moves

Using Metal Burst with this set up allows you to deal damage equal to your Pokémon's HP upon being hit. The Toxic Orb + Poison Heal Variant allows you to heal back up without Berries.
It is recommended to have other Pokémon able to use Damage over Time (DoT) moves such as Leech Seed, Salt Cure and Curse.

Instead, I recommend focusing getting Late-Game Setup ready. Many Shedinja fusions, for example, can fully immune Eternatus and a lot more Pokémon on top of that.

    nature = Timid
    moves = Mystical Power / Psychic, Core Enforcer, Fusion Flare, Aura Sphere / Calm Mind
    comment = - Latias is a strong Special Attacker in Mega form with good enough Speed to have sweeping capabilities
- Timid allows outspeeding of many top threats and with Carbos/X Speed can easily out-speed the final bosses
- Mystical Power and Aura Sphere is the better combination overall but if you're missing an Egg Move you can use Calm Mind and Psychic to close to the same effect

Latias is a strong, fast and surprisingly bulky Special Attacker with the added benefit of Prism Armor to help its survivability. It does want its Mega Evolution to truly shine but with its high stats in the early stages it can easily be useful until you pull the Mega Evolution.

    passive =
    ability = Flash Fire
    fusion = None
    nature = Timid
    moves = Fiery Dance, Astral Barrage, Moonblast, Earth Power
    comment = - Chandelure has an extremely high Special Attack for a non-Legendary
- Timid is necessary to make up for its middling Speed (probably also want Carbos/Soul Dews/X Speed to be safe)
- Soul-Heart allows it to snowball quickly with boosts, if you're not comfortable with that and 50% chance from Fiery Dance and want to boost before attacking you can slot Calm Mind in for one of the coverage moves

Chandelure hits extremely hard especially when snowballing through slower enemies with Soul-Heart and Fiery Dance. Ability isn't as important but if you are able to read a Fire type attack and switch in to it with Chandelure Flash Fire will make Fiery Dance hit like a nuke.

    passive =
    ability = Flame Body / Flash Fire
    fusion = None
    nature = Timid / Calm
    moves = Curse, Will-O-Wisp / Toxic, Fire Spin / Fiery Dance, Pain Split
    comment = - Chandelure has a unique trait of 4 passive damage options as well as Pain Split
- Timid is good for improving its Speed but Calm is also an option to help remedy its middling bulk
- Soul-Heart still activates off of Passive Damage which means this set can still do good boosted damage with only one Attacking move as well

Chandelure has an interesting set of features to pull off a set like this, its bulk isn't the greatest so it'll need to use Pain Split quite a bit to heal itself after getting Curse off which is only really used for significant threats such as the final 2 bosses. If you run Flame Body you may prefer Toxic for more passive damage options but Will-O-Wisp guarantees crippling physical attackers allowing it to survive longer
